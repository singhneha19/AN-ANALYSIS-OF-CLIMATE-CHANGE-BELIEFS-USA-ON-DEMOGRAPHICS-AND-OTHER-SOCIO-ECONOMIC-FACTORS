# AN-ANALYSIS-OF-CLIMATE-CHANGE-BELIEFS-USA-ON-DEMOGRAPHICS-AND-OTHER-SOCIO-ECONOMIC-FACTORS
Public opinion about global warming is an important influence on decision making about policies to reduce global warming or prepare for the impacts, but We can't get people to vote for adopting the policies unless people believe that Global Warming is happening and Global Warming is caused mostly by human activities. But American opinions vary widely depending on where people live, our project is based on the Yale climate opinion maps-2016 surveys outcome where 18,000 American people survey response was recorded about opinion on climate change 7 in 10 American   believes that global warming is happening. the study conducted by Yale was based on certain set of question being asked and people got surveyed on the basis of metro cities, counties and state wise, the outcome of the opinion survey is result of some statistical models. for our further study where we wanted to know that what are demographic factors like race, age ,sex and income, ,education level of people who believes or in favor of global warming happening and people who oppose the idea of global warming. To carry out this study we combine us-census -demographic data.   And we also added more factors like temperature anomalies by counties from noaa.gov. After combining the data sets from different sources which was a  huge task  we ran model in SAS MINER ran model regression and  neural network and got outcome like Race (Asian, White, Hispanic believes more), Gender (men believe less),Education (people with bachelorâ€™s degrees believe more),Community type (rural people believe less), Average temp anomaly, precipitation anomaly, precipitation inches are important factor and where government and people's individual efforts work better to fight bad effects of climate change.
